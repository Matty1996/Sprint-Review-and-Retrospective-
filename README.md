Sprint Review and Retrospective (Matt Kakarkeo)
How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

  User stories are a critical component to the Agile approach. They help develop a clear understanding of what the project should do, what they want it to look like, etc... The user stories helps the team figure out which function of the application need to be worked on first and which are the most inportant. This information is critical in developing a well functioning application.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

  The big benefit of the agile process is that because of the user stories, there is a clear understanding of the project and the current section that is being worked on. By having this information, there are less questions on where or how to start and the process can begin. I would work on the current assignment and test it frequently. Develop one section or function and test it, then move onto the next function. If any bugs or issues come up, that I cannot solve, I will reveal the problem to the team in the daily scrum meeting, where it can be discussed and solved. 
  
What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

  A good team member is an honest team member. We are each given a role in the Scrum team and our team is relying on us to complete our part of the project. If I have an issue or problem that I cannot solve, I would utilize the Scrum team, and solve the problem with them. If I can solve it on my own or provide my own help to solve another team member's problem, I would.
